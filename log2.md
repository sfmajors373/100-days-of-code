# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on setting up a Ubuntu vm to run solaris (the utilities library for the Spacenet dataset), which I can't run on my normal install due to issues with my Python version, so I am running a vm to try to make it install correctly there.  I got further than I did locally, but am having an issue with a pip wrapper now, so I will continue on that tomorrow.  I also worked on Udacity Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch lesson 6.10 and 6.11 which is the preparation for creating a multi-layer perceptron for classifying MNIST images.

**Thoughts:**  Today was just set up for more interesting stuff tomorrow.

### Day 1: December 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on setting up the vm for solaris.  I keep trying to go quickly and making stupid mistakes and then throwing it out and starting over.  Bad practice all over.  I also checked out the introduction videos and lesson 1.1 and 1.2 in the Intel Edge scholarship Udacity course.

**Thoughts:**  Unfortunately, I was not in a great mental space for productively coding today.  Hopefully, I can get this vm working tonight but if not there is always tomorrow.  I just really want to move on to actually working on the project.

**Link to work:** Nothing to show today
