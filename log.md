# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 11, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Queue, Linked List and beginning of Hash Table in JS

**Thoughts:** Lambda School University, pair programming and learning as much as I can.

### Day 1: July 12, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Hash table, and for today's morning code challenge to change case from lower to upper/upper to lower.

**Thoughts**: I didn't quite finish the hash table before reviewing the solutions, however I did get the function to stop passing back undefined.

### Day 2: July 13, Thursday 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on an algorithm for the largest prime palindrome under a certain number, trees, and binary search trees.  

**Thoughts** I spent a very long time on trees, but didn't finish anything else I worked on today.  I did realize that for Prime Palindromes, I need to break down the problem into smaller more managable problems in order to make the algorithm work correctly.  Hopefully, I will be quickly learn to be able to realize that sooner in the future so that I am not wasting so much time.

### Day 3: July 14, 2017 Friday

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the prime palindrome problem from yesterday before we went over the answers to it.  Graphs and Binary Search Trees.

**Thoughts**  I haven't finished any of the things I worked on today, and I didn't get this morning's coding challenge yet either.  I like graphs though - so much can be modeled with graphs.

### Day 4: July 15, 2017 Saturday
**Today's Progress**:  Not much progress.  Worked on algorithm for even occurences in an array.
**Thoughts**: Still struggling to break problems down small enough to not allow room for confusion.

### Day 5: July 16, 2017 Sunday
**Today's Progress**: Worked on binary search tree and a method for graphs that removes edges.
**Thoughts**:  I still have a long way to go.

### Day 6: July 17, 2017 Monday
**Today's Progress**: Worked on redoing the graph remove edges, but made little progress.  Began an assignment on the DOM utilizing mainly HTML and CSS.
**Thoughts**: Feeling very lost in the HTML stuff.

### Day 7: July 18, 2017 Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Continued replicating the Lambda School website using only HTML and CSS.
**Thoughts**:  One week into 100 days.  Yay!  And happy birthday me.

### Day 8: July 19, 2017 Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Worked on filling out the block architecture that I set up for the Lambda School website replica.
**Thoughts**:  My replica looks very vaguely like the Lambda School site.  It has the spirit of it but none of the details.  For having used HTML and CSS so little, I am not entirely ashamed of my progress on the project.  Tomorrow starts a new project and I look forward to that.

### Day 9: July 20, 2017 Thursday
**Today's Progress**: Beginning of a To Do App with React.
**Thoughts**:  A little overwhelmed by the number of ways to represent an idea in React.  I spent most of the day reading up on React, syntax, structure, etc.

### Day 10: July 21, 2017 Friday
**Today's Progress**:  Continue work on To Do App in React.
**Thoughts**: Debugging this is a nightmare.

### Day 11: July 23, 2017 Sunday
**Today's Progress**: Worked on replicating an array class, but trying to understand outside the framework of JavaScript and at a level closer to the metal, including memory management.
**Thoughts**: Making an attempt to adjust my thinking to be broader than thinking within the language so that I can understand what the computer is actually doing.

### Day 12, July 24, 2017 Monday
**Today's Progress**:  Beginning a new project with React which tries to recreate a page on Instagram.
**Thoughts**:  Looking forward to a new project in React.  The to do list  got rather messy because my thought process just wasn't aligned with React in the beginning and I am hoping that I learned enough in the last project to make this one go a bit better.

### Day 13: July 25, 2017 Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Working towards adding the functionality of the Instagram and appropriately managing state.
**Thoughts**: Seeing the objects being created by the props in the console of the browser helped to understand what passing props is doing.  That doesn't mean that I am not having problems passing the props correctly anymore because I definitely am, but it was good to see.

###Day 14: July 26, 2017 Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Attained minimum required functionality prior to turning in the project.
**Thoughts**: My partner brought in the TA to help us debug the final bug in our project just before we turned it in.  The pair programming and TA help worked really well on this project.  I felt badly not having contributed more to the functionality of the app, but I am struggling to come to understand the framework.

###Day 15: July 27, 2017 Thursday
**Today's Progress**: The new project is attempting to build a todo list app but this time utilize both React and Redux.  I set up the majority of the app, but utilized the redux tutorial in order to help conceptualize how to set up and structure the app.
**Thoughts**: I thought I would understand better by using the tutorial for help structuring the components, reducers, actions, etc.  But I still have a bug that I don't understand how to get rid of so I may just throw this out and start over.  Feeling very frustrated by layering a framework over a framework that I don't understand.

###Day 16: July 28, 2017 Friday
**Today's Progress**:  Continued work on the new To do list project, also made progress by adding a router to my Github Battle project - it looks nice might I add.  :)  Also setting out in search of other tutorials that utilize react and redux so that I can attempt to cement my understanding of these concepts before the next Lambda School project.
**Thoughts**: I'm still feeling really lost, but I spent some time today in Code Sandbox with the Redux tutorial code - playing with it, breaking it, styling it...  I learned some, but I need more practice before I think I will be able to internalize all of this information.

###Day 17: Monday July 31, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Assigned a new project utilizing React and Redux as before but also JS promises and AJAX requests.
**Thoughts**: So far I am feeling alright with the project.  They gave a good overview of the architecture that needs to be in place in order to make this app, so hopefully that will be enough for me to pick up from there and add the functionality.

###Day 18: Tuesday August 1, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Worked on AJAX project.
**Thoughts**: Still very confused about React/Redux, how to use axios, seems to be many steps and I am not sure about them.

###Day 19: Wednesday, August 2, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Figured out most of the AJAX request and turned in the project, but didn't quite have a working project.
**Thoughts**: By working through the Q&A video from last night and implementing some of the code discussed there, I was able to iron out my AJAX requests, but was unable to map dispatch and state to props and didn't remember to use bindActions.  Still confusion related to redux mostly, I suppose.

###Day 20: Thursday, August 3, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Worked on the new project which is an app that uses React Router.  I have the majority of the structure down, and some of the links working.
**Thoughts**: Some of the links work so that makes me excited.

###Day 21: Friday, August 4, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Finished both the routing project and an app that I have been slowly working on in my spare time, which was following a React fundamentals course by Tyler McGinnis.
**Thoughts**: Turned out the problems with my non-functional links were all typos.  And two finished apps in one day - exciting!  Now to figure out what to work on next...

###Day 22: Monday, August 7, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Received a new project for learning unit tests, TDD and BDD, using Mocha, Chai and Sinon.
**Thoughts**: Glad for the break from React!

###Day 23: Tuesday, August 8, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Continued making tests for the project, worked mainly on making the base tests for each function to be tested.
**Thoughts**: Enjoying the work.

###Day 24: Wednesday, August 9, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Finished as many of the tests as I could prior to turning in the project - mainly focusing on using sinon spy to monitor callbacks.  Also worked on the 'mini-lab' to learn node and express through making hangman to be played by making get and post requests.
**Thoughts**:  Good stuff - not many thoughts today.  Enjoyed the mini-lab.
