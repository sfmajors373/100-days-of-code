# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 11, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Queue, Linked List and beginning of Hash Table in JS

**Thoughts:** Lambda School University, pair programming and learning as much as I can.

### Day 1: July 12, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Hash table, and for today's morning code challenge to change case from lower to upper/upper to lower.

**Thoughts**: I didn't quite finish the hash table before reviewing the solutions, however I did get the function to stop passing back undefined.

### Day 2: July 13, Thursday 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on an algorithm for the largest prime palindrome under a certain number, trees, and binary search trees.  

**Thoughts** I spent a very long time on trees, but didn't finish anything else I worked on today.  I did realize that for Prime Palindromes, I need to break down the problem into smaller more managable problems in order to make the algorithm work correctly.  Hopefully, I will be quickly learn to be able to realize that sooner in the future so that I am not wasting so much time.

### Day 3: July 14, 2017 Friday

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the prime palindrome problem from yesterday before we went over the answers to it.  Graphs and Binary Search Trees.

**Thoughts**  I haven't finished any of the things I worked on today, and I didn't get this morning's coding challenge yet either.  I like graphs though - so much can be modeled with graphs.

### Day 4: July 15, 2017 Saturday
**Today's Progress**:  Not much progress.  Worked on algorithm for even occurences in an array.
**Thoughts**: Still struggling to break problems down small enough to not allow room for confusion.

### Day 5: July 16, 2017 Sunday
**Today's Progress**: Worked on binary search tree and a method for graphs that removes edges.
**Thoughts**:  I still have a long way to go.

### Day 6: July 17, 2017 Monday
**Today's Progress**: Worked on redoing the graph remove edges, but made little progress.  Began an assignment on the DOM utilizing mainly HTML and CSS.
**Thoughts**: Feeling very lost in the HTML stuff.

### Day 7: July 18, 2017 Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Continued replicating the Lambda School website using only HTML and CSS.
**Thoughts**:  One week into 100 days.  Yay!  And happy birthday me.
