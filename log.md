**Today's Progress**: Queue, Linked List and beginning of Hash Table in JS

**Thoughts:** Lambda School University, pair programming and learning as much as I can.

**Today's Progress**: Hash table, and for today's morning code challenge to change case from lower to upper/upper to lower.

**Thoughts**: I didn't quite finish the hash table before reviewing the solutions, however I did get the function to stop passing back undefined.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
